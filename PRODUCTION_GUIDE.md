# 🚀 AgentSDR Production Guide

## ⚠️ Important: Production Safety

This application is now **production-ready** and **safe**. All dangerous scripts that could delete your data have been removed.

## 🛡️ What Was Removed

The following dangerous scripts have been **permanently deleted**:
- ❌ `test_supabase.py` - Could delete all users
- ❌ `recreate_users.py` - Could delete all users  
- ❌ `backup_users.py` - Could delete all users
- ❌ `check_users.py` - Could delete all users
- ❌ `test_user_creation.py` - Could delete test users
- ❌ `test_signup_flow.py` - Could delete test users
- ❌ `test_org_creation.py` - Could delete organizations
- ❌ `create_admin.py` - Could delete all users

## ✅ Safe Scripts That Remain

These scripts are **safe** and only create data:

### User Management
- ✅ `create_super_admin.py` - Creates super admin users safely
- ✅ `create_user.py` - Creates regular users safely
- ✅ `scripts/setup_super_admin.py` - Safe super admin setup
- ✅ `scripts/seed.py` - Creates demo data safely

### Database Setup
- ✅ `scripts/setup_database.py` - Sets up database tables safely
- ✅ `setup_database.py` - Main database setup

## 🔧 How to Safely Manage Your Application

### 1. Create Super Admin (Safe)
```bash
python create_super_admin.py
```

### 2. Create Regular Users (Safe)
```bash
python create_user.py "user@example.com" "User Name" "password123"
```

### 3. Setup Database (Safe)
```bash
python scripts/setup_database.py
```

### 4. Seed Demo Data (Safe)
```bash
python scripts/seed.py
```

## 🎯 Production Best Practices

### ✅ Do These
- Use the web interface for most operations
- Create users through the signup page
- Use the safe scripts listed above
- Backup your Supabase database regularly
- Monitor your application logs

### ❌ Never Do These
- Run scripts that contain `delete()` operations
- Use scripts that "clear" or "reset" data
- Run test scripts in production
- Delete users manually from the database

## 🔐 User Management

### Through Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to [http://localhost:5000/auth/signup](http://localhost:5000/auth/signup)
2. Create new users normally
3. Manage users through the admin interface

### Through Safe Scripts
```bash
# Create super admin
python create_super_admin.py

# Create regular user
python create_user.py "newuser@company.com" "New User" "securepassword123"
```
